# Connect SDK Cordova/PhoneGap Plugin

Connect SDK is an open source framework that unifies device discovery and connectivity by providing one set of methods that work across multiple television platforms and protocols.

This repository is a fork of the [original one](https://github.com/ConnectSDK/Connect-SDK-Cordova-Plugin)

Plugin installation scripts have been refactorized to install plugin correctly using last node and cordova versions.

For more information, visit [Connect SDK Developers website](http://www.svlconnectsdk.com/docs/1-6-0/cordova/).

## Dependencies

These steps assume you have a basic working knowledge of development for Android, iOS and Cordova/PhoneGap. For these steps to work, you will need the following:

If you are only developing for one platform, feel free to ignore the steps & requirements for the irrelevant platform.
